You need to fix a variable source-code file, which was created using conditional compilation directives from a set of cloned variants, so that it can be successfully built.
Our goal is to ensure that the variable source-code file can actually be compiled without any errors. 

Context: 
Source code file is written in C. 
Error occurs when building the {{replace with variant name which error occurs}} variant.

Instructions:
Below are the instructions you need to follow.
1. You should only modify code related to {{replace with variant name which error occurs}} variant, because with this variant we are getting an error.
2. Fix all syntax errors in the variable source-code file
3. Add any missing statements from the set of cloned variants to the variable source-code file which could have been missed during the initial creation
4. Reorder any existing statements in the variable file which could resolve the error
5. Your response should consist of only the variable source-code file and nothing else. 
6. The source-code should be properly formatted and indented

Input: 
Below is the set of cloned variants from which the variable file was created
```c
{{replace with cloned variable file}}

```

Below is the variable source-code file
```c
{{replace with variable file with error}}

```

Below is the command used for building and the error that occurs
```bash
{{replace with build error}}

```
