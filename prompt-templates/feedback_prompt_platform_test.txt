You need to fix a variable C source-code file, which uses conditional compilation, so that the unit tests can successfully pass on it.
Our goal is to ensure that the variable source-code file has the correct functionality.
   
Context: 
Source code file is written in C. 
A unit-test named `{{replace with failed test name}}` fails when building the `{{replace with variant for which error occurs}}` variant.

Instructions:
Below are the instructions you need to follow.
1. Suggest changes to only the C source-code file and please provide the complete file in the output.

Inputs: 
Consider the below variable source-code file which uses conditional compilation directives to derive different variants out of a single file.

```c
{{replace with source-code file causing test error}}

```

When the following unit test is run on the above file for variant `{{replace with variant for which error occurs}}`, test `{{replace with failed test name}}` fails with the following log.

```c++
{{replace with test file with error}}

```

Here is the log of the unit test

```bash
{{replace with failed test execution log}}

```
