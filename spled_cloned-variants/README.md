# Cloned Variants of the SPLED project

This folder contains single variants of the [SPLed](https://github.com/avengineers/SPLed) project.

## ðŸ¤–Clone and Own

The purpose of this repository is to provide cloned software variants that can serve as a case study for re-engineering these variants into a Software Product Line (SPL). By including an already existing SPL corresponding to these variants, this repository enables benchmarking and comparison of various re-engineering approaches.

To overcome the issue of biased results, instead of generating the variants from SPLed, we reverse-engineer SPLed into four cloned variants by implementing a simple variant from scratch and then manually copying and modifying three additional variants, introducing unique features into each clone.

The clone and own process is illustrated in the following figure:
